## 2. Installation Instructions üíª

To set up tripAi on your local machine and start contributing, follow these comprehensive steps:

**Prerequisites:**

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher is strongly recommended for optimal compatibility with the latest Expo features and dependencies)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes bundled with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (recommended for significantly faster and more reliable dependency management)
*   [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/): Install globally using either:
    ```bash
    npm install -g expo-cli
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn global add expo-cli
    ```
*   A robust Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as VS Code is highly recommended, along with the following extensions to enhance your development experience:
    *   TypeScript extension for comprehensive type checking and code completion.
    *   React Native extension for debugging and code snippets specific to React Native development.
    *   ESLint/Prettier extensions for automatic code formatting and consistent style enforcement.
*   Either an Android emulator/device or an iOS simulator/device for testing and debugging.
    *   **Android:** Android Studio is required to set up Android emulators and connect to physical Android devices. Consider using [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) for a faster and more performant Android emulator compared to the default Android Studio emulator.
    *   **iOS:** Xcode is required to be installed on your macOS system to utilize the iOS simulator or connect to physical iOS devices.
*   (Optional, but Recommended) [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and collaborative development.

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd tripAi
    ```
    (Replace `[YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]` with the actual URL of the tripAi GitHub repository you forked.)

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Employ either npm or Yarn to install the necessary project dependencies. Yarn is generally preferred for its speed and dependency resolution capabilities.

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

    *Note:* Yarn consistently outperforms npm in terms of speed and dependency management reliability. If you encounter any issues with `npm`, we strongly recommend switching to `yarn` for a smoother experience.

3.  **Start the Development Server:**

    Initiate the Expo development server using either of the following commands:

    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    This command will launch the Expo DevTools interface within your web browser.  The DevTools will display a QR code that can be scanned using the Expo Go app on your physical mobile device (if you prefer testing on a physical device rather than an emulator/simulator).

4.  **Run the App:**

    The Expo DevTools provides a range of options for running the application on your chosen platform:

    *   **Run on Android device/emulator:** Requires a properly configured Android emulator (using Android Studio or Genymotion) or a physical Android device with the Expo Go application installed. Simply scan the QR code displayed in Expo DevTools using the Expo Go app on your device.
    *   **Run on iOS simulator:** Mandates the installation of Xcode on your macOS system. Click the "Run on iOS Simulator" button within Expo DevTools to launch the app in the iOS simulator.
    *   **Run in the web browser:** This option enables basic testing and prototyping within your web browser environment. However, it's crucial to note that certain native features may not be fully supported or functional in this mode.

    Select your preferred option from the Expo DevTools interface to launch the application. Carefully follow any additional instructions or prompts provided by the Expo development environment.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   If you encounter any issues during the installation process, ensure that your Node.js and npm/Yarn versions are up-to-date. Consider utilizing `nvm` (Node Version Manager) to effectively manage multiple Node.js versions and seamlessly switch between them as needed.
*   Thoroughly consult the comprehensive Expo documentation available at [https://docs.expo.dev/](https://docs.expo.dev/) for detailed information, troubleshooting tips, and solutions to common errors. Pay particular attention to the dedicated "Common Issues" section, which addresses frequently encountered problems.
*   Verify that you have installed all the necessary Software Development Kits (SDKs) and build tools required for your target platform (Android or iOS). Refer to the official Android and iOS developer documentation for detailed installation and configuration instructions.
*   In cases where you experience issues with native modules, a rebuild of the project may be necessary. Attempt to resolve the problem by deleting the `node_modules` directory and then reinstalling all project dependencies.
*   Ensure that the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is correctly configured if you are developing for Android.
*   If you are using a physical device, ensure that USB debugging is enabled on your Android device or that your iOS device is properly trusted.

## 3. Usage Examples üöÄ

The following examples demonstrate fundamental aspects of using tripAi. Please note that some features are still actively under development and may not be fully implemented in the current version. These examples showcase core concepts and can serve as a foundation for further exploration and expansion.

**Example 1: Basic Navigation using Expo Router**

This demonstrates how Expo Router facilitates navigation between different screens within the app.  Expo Router uses file-based routing so that the structure of your `app/` directory determines the navigation structure.

```typescript
// In app/_layout.tsx (the root layout file for Expo's file-based routing)
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';
import React from 'react';

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <Stack>
      {/* Define screen options here, such as header styling */}
      <Stack.Screen name="index" options={{ title: 'tripAi', headerShown: false }} /> {/* `index` refers to `app/index.tsx`, which is the default route */}
      <Stack.Screen name="screens/HomeScreen" options={{ title: 'Home', headerShown: true }} /> {/* Example: Access this screen via `router.push('/screens/HomeScreen')` */}
      {/*  You can define more Stack.Screen components here for other routes.  */}
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

```typescript
// In app/index.tsx (or a similar entry point file - the default route)
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate a splash screen display (optional). Remove this `setTimeout` if you don't want a splash screen
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      router.replace('/screens/HomeScreen'); // Navigate to the HomeScreen *after* the delay.  `replace` prevents going back to the splash screen.
    }, 2000);

    // Clean up the timer if the component unmounts (important to prevent memory leaks!)
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Welcome to tripAi!</Text>
      <Text style={styles.subtitle}>Loading...</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0', // A light background
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 28,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#333', // A darker text color
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  subtitle: {
    fontSize: 18,
    color: '#666',
  },
});
```

```typescript
// In app/screens/HomeScreen.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const HomeScreen = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Welcome to the Home Screen!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#fff', // White background
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#007AFF', // Use a brand color (e.g., iOS blue)
  },
});

export default HomeScreen;
```

**Example 2: Fetching and Displaying Destination Data (Simulated API)**

This illustrates how to fetch destination data, in this case from mock data to simulate an API, and display it in a `FlatList`.  Remember to install `axios`: `npm install axios` or `yarn add axios`. In a real-world application, you would replace the mock data with a real API endpoint.

```typescript
// In app/screens/HomeScreen.tsx (or a dedicated component)
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, FlatList, StyleSheet, Image } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios'; // Uncomment this line when you have a real API endpoint
// import { Destination } from '../../types'; // Import the Destination type (see below)

// Define the Destination interface or type
interface Destination {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  imageUrl: string; // URL to the destination image
}

const HomeScreen = () => {
  const [destinations, setDestinations] = useState<Destination[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        // UNCOMMENT THESE LINES to use a real API endpoint
        // const response = await axios.get<Destination[]>('https://api.example.com/destinations');
        // setDestinations(response.data);

        // *** MOCK DATA (Remove this block when using a real API endpoint) ***
        const mockData: Destination[] = [
          { id: 1, name: 'Paris', description: 'Experience the romance of Paris.', imageUrl: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/La_Tour_Eiffel_vue_de_Trocad%C3%A9ro.jpg/800px-La_Tour_Eiffel_vue_de_Trocad%C3%A9ro.jpg' },
          { id: 2, name: 'Tokyo', description: 'Explore the vibrant metropolis of Tokyo.', imageUrl: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Skyscrapers_of_Shinjuku_2009_January.jpg/800px-Skyscrapers_of_Shinjuku_2009_January.jpg' },
          { id: 3, name: 'New York City', description: 'Discover the city that never sleeps, New York.', imageUrl: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Empire_State_Building_close_up.jpg/800px-Empire_State_Building_close_up.jpg' },
          { id: 4, name: 'Rome', description: 'Explore the historical wonders of Rome.', imageUrl: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Colosseum-inside-Rome.jpg/800px-Colosseum-inside-Rome.jpg' },
          { id: 5, name: 'London', description: 'Visit the iconic landmarks of London.', imageUrl: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Westminster_palace_clock_tower.jpg/800px-Westminster_palace_clock_tower.jpg' },
        ];
        setDestinations(mockData);
        // *** END OF MOCK DATA ***
      } catch (err: any) { // Use `any` type temporarily for error handling
        console.error('Error fetching data:', err.message || err); // Log the specific error message
        setError('Failed to load destinations. Please try again later.');
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  if (loading) {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text>Loading destinations...</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }

  if (error) {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.errorText}>Error: {error}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Featured Destinations</Text>
      <FlatList
        data={destinations}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
        renderItem={({ item }) => (
          <View style={styles.destinationItem}>
            <Image source={{ uri: item.imageUrl }} style={styles.destinationImage} />
            <Text style={styles.destinationName}>{item.name}</Text>
            <Text style={styles.destinationDescription}>{item.description}</Text>
          </View>
        )}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: '#f9f9f9',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 28,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 16,
    color: '#333',
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
  destinationItem: {
    marginBottom: 20,
    padding: 15,
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ddd',
    borderRadius: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    shadowColor: '#000',
    shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
    shadowOpacity: 0.1,
    shadowRadius: 2,
    elevation: 3, // For Android shadow
  },
  destinationImage: {
    width: '100%',
    height: 200,
    borderRadius: 8,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  destinationName: {
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#007AFF',
  },
  destinationDescription: {
    fontSize: 16,
    color: '#555',
  },
  errorText: {
    fontSize: 16,
    color: 'red',
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
});

export default HomeScreen;
```

**Example 3: Handling User Input and Filtering Results**

This example shows a basic search implementation, where a TextInput is used to capture user input and then filters a list of destinations based on the search term.  This example uses static data.

```typescript
// In app/screens/SearchScreen.tsx (or a separate component)
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, StyleSheet, FlatList, Text } from 'react-native';

// Define a Destination interface
interface Destination {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
}

const SearchScreen = () => {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  const [searchResults, setSearchResults] = useState<Destination[]>([]);

  // Static destination data (replace with API call in a real application)
  const destinations: Destination[] = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Paris, France', description: 'The city of love and lights.' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Tokyo, Japan', description: 'A blend of tradition and modernity.' },
    { id: 3, name: 'New York City, USA', description: 'The city that never sleeps.' },
    { id: 4, name: 'London, England', description: 'A historic city with a modern flair.' },
    { id: 5, name: 'Rome, Italy', description: 'Home to ancient ruins and vibrant culture.' },
    { id: 6, name: 'Sydney, Australia', description: 'A harbor city with iconic landmarks.' },
  ];

  const handleSearch = () => {
    const filteredResults = destinations.filter(destination =>
      destination.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
    );
    setSearchResults(filteredResults);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        placeholder="Search for a destination..."
        value={searchTerm}
        onChangeText={(text) => {
          setSearchTerm(text);
          // Consider adding a delay (debounce) before calling handleSearch for performance
          handleSearch();
        }}
      />
      {searchResults.length > 0 ? (
        <FlatList
          data={searchResults}
          keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
          renderItem={({ item }) => (
            <View style={styles.resultItem}>
              <Text style={styles.resultName}>{item.name}</Text>
              <Text style={styles.resultDescription}>{item.description}</Text>
            </View>
          )}
        />
      ) : (
        <Text style={styles.noResultsText}>No results found for "{searchTerm}"</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },
  input: {
    height: 45,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
    borderWidth: 1,
    marginBottom: 15,
    paddingHorizontal: 15,
    borderRadius: 8,
    fontSize: 16,
  },
  resultItem: {
    padding: 15,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#eee',
  },
  resultName: {
    fontSize: 18,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#333',
  },
  resultDescription: {
    fontSize: 14,
    color: '#666',
  },
  noResultsText: {
    fontSize: 16,
    color: '#888',
    textAlign: 'center',
    marginTop: 20,
  },
});

export default SearchScreen;
```

## 4. Project Structure üìÇ

The project structure is organized following Expo's conventions, leveraging the file-based routing mechanism offered by `expo-router`. This promotes a clear and maintainable codebase.

*   `app/`: This is the core directory that houses the application's code, including screens, components, and navigation logic. `expo-router` treats each file directly within `app/` as a distinct route. The `app/index.tsx` file serves as the root or default route for the application.
*   `app/_layout.tsx`: This file defines the root layout for the entire app, providing a centralized location to configure navigation options, theme settings, and shared components. It uses `expo-router`'s layout capabilities to create a consistent structure across all screens.
*   `assets/`: This directory stores static assets such as images, fonts, and icon files that are used throughout the application.
*   `components/`: (Highly Recommended) This directory is dedicated to storing reusable UI components that are not directly tied to a specific route or screen. These components can be imported and used across multiple parts of the application, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
*   `utils/`: (Highly Recommended) This directory is designated for housing utility functions, helper classes, and other non-UI-related code that performs common tasks or calculations. This promotes separation of concerns and improves code organization.
*   `app.json`: This file contains the application's configuration, including essential details such as the app's name, version number, icon definitions, and platform-specific settings.
*   `package.json`: This file lists the project's dependencies (including third-party libraries and packages) and defines the scripts used for building, testing, and running the application.
*   `tsconfig.json`: This file configures the TypeScript compiler settings, specifying how TypeScript code should be transpiled into JavaScript.
